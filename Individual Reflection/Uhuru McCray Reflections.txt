Game: Blinker
Group 4: Max, Mandy


Game Description:
Top down shooter based on the fantasy adventure classic game Gaunlet. Blinker is a good wizard who fights his way through a castle filled with
his wand spell and teleportation abilties. I worked on the Map, player projectile classes. 

Challenges:
The biggest challenge was the pace of the learning SDL and C++ while simultaneously making a game. Fortunately I had support of my colleagues who
answered my questions and explained as thoroughly as possible. A personal lesson  i received from this project was new way of studying that includes dedicating 
blocks of time for studying even when working a project that I lack knowledge of at the beginning. Another challenge in a group collaboration I expereinced
was sifting through code to find relevant and useful tools to what I was working on. I believe more annotation in the group projects would save
a lot of time. 

Conclusion:
Even though it was extremely challenging I really enjoyed both SDL and C++, I plan to keep working with the smaller frameworks like SDL to strengthen 
my skills and knowledge for the foreseeable future.
